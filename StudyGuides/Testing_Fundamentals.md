# Testing Fundamentals

## Testing Documents

Testing documents are essential artifacts that guide the testing process and help maintain a structured approach to testing. These documents document the testing strategy, plan, test cases, and results, ensuring comprehensive and organized testing efforts.

**Examples of Testing Documents:**

- **Test Plan:** Outlines the scope, objectives, approach, resources, and schedule of testing.
- **Test Cases:** Detailed instructions to execute a specific test scenario, including input data, expected results, and steps.
- **Test Scripts:** Automation scripts created to automate the execution of test cases.
- **Test Data:** Data used in test cases, including input values and expected results.
- **Test Reports:** Summarize the testing activities, including passed, failed, and pending tests.

## Testing Mindset

Testing mindset involves thinking critically and creatively to uncover defects in a software application. It's about exploring different scenarios, understanding user behavior, and questioning assumptions about how the software should work. A good testing mindset helps testers to identify unexpected issues that automated tests might miss.

**Example of Testing Mindset:**
Consider testing a registration form. A testing mindset would involve:

- Providing valid and invalid input data.
- Testing edge cases (e.g., maximum and minimum input lengths).
- Exploring various combinations of inputs.
- Trying unexpected inputs that might cause errors.

## Testing Lifecycle

The testing lifecycle consists of several phases from planning to execution and reporting. It involves activities like requirement analysis, test planning, designing test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects. This structured approach ensures a systematic and thorough testing process.

**Example of Testing Lifecycle Phases:**

- **Requirement Analysis:** Understand the application requirements and identify testable aspects.
- **Test Planning:** Develop a test strategy, plan, and select test cases to be executed.
- **Test Design:** Create detailed test cases or scenarios based on the requirements.
- **Test Execution:** Execute the test cases, either manually or through automation.
- **Defect Reporting:** Document and report any issues found during testing.
- **Test Closure:** Review the test results, summarize testing efforts, and provide a testing report.

## Basic Test Concepts

Basic test concepts cover foundational principles of testing, such as understanding what to test, designing test cases, executing tests, and analyzing results.

**Examples of Basic Test Concepts:**

- Examination, analysis, observations, and evaluations of different aspects of the item
- Combination of manual and automated testing tools
- Testers create reports after testing and show it to the development team
- There is a common process, including defining the test environment, developing test cases, writing scripts, analyzing test results, and submitting defect reports
- Testing principles:
    - Testing shows the presence of defects
    - Exhaustive testing is not possible
    - Early Testing
    - Defect Clustering
    - Pesticide Paradox
    - Absence of Errors Fallacy

## Manual Testing

Manual testing involves human intervention to execute test cases without using automation tools. It's crucial to ensure that an application works as intended by simulating user interactions.

**Example of Manual Testing:**
Imagine testing a search functionality in an e-commerce site:

- Manually entering various search queries.
- Checking if the correct results are displayed.
- Verifying that sorting and filtering options work.

## Testing Terminology

Testing terminology refers to the specific vocabulary used in software testing. Understanding these terms is essential for clear communication among testers and stakeholders.

**Examples of Testing Terminology:**

- **Defect:** An imperfection or flaw in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly.
- **Test Case:** A set of conditions and steps to be executed to verify software behavior.
- **Bug:** An informal term for a defect or an issue in the software.
- **Test Suite:** A collection of related test cases.
- **Smoke Testing:** A quick round of testing to determine if the software build is stable enough for detailed testing.
